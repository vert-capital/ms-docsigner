This document outlines the architectural approach for `ms-docsigner`, which serves as a foundational template for new Go microservices. Its primary goal is to provide a guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring seamless integration of new features within a well-defined, existing system.

### Existing Project Analysis

#### Current Project State
- **Primary Purpose:** To serve as a robust, reusable template for new Go microservices, implementing the Clean Architecture pattern.
- **Current Tech Stack:** Go (1.21), Gin, GORM, PostgreSQL, Confluent Kafka, Logrus, Docker.
- **Architecture Style:** A well-defined Clean Architecture, with clear separation of concerns between entities, use cases, interface adapters, and frameworks.
- **Deployment Method:** Containerized deployment using Docker.

#### Available Documentation
- A comprehensive analysis is available in `docs/project-analysis.md`.
- API documentation is auto-generated via Swaggo.

#### Identified Constraints
- The architecture is designed to be a template, so any additions must be generic or serve as clear, understandable examples.
- New dependencies should be added sparingly to keep the template lightweight.
